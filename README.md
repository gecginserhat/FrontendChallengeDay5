🎯 Day 5 of my 21-day coding challenge, and today I tested my skills by building a landing page for my course website! 🌐<br/>

🔍 Here's what I accomplished:<br/>

- **Navbar & Responsive Design**: Developed a sleek, responsive navbar that adapts to different screen sizes.<br/>
- **Introduction Section**: Coded a captivating introduction section to grab visitors' attention.<br/>
- **Courses Section**: Showcased the available courses with a clean, organized layout.<br/>
- **Contact & Social Media Section**: Created an engaging contact section with links to social media profiles.<br/>

🔥 The landing page is shaping up nicely! I’ve deployed the project on Vercel, so you can check out what I’ve built so far. Feel free to explore it yourself!<br/>
